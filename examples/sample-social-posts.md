## Post 1 — Hook Formula #6: Harsh Reality

**Hook**: Harsh reality: your marketing attribution is lying to you.

**Full post**:

Harsh reality: your marketing attribution is lying to you.

I've talked to 40+ marketing directors this quarter. Every single one has the same problem.

They have 7 dashboards. 12 reports. And zero confidence in which campaigns actually drive revenue.

GA4 says one thing. HubSpot says another. Their spreadsheet model says something else entirely.

So when the CFO asks "what did we get for that $200K?" they wing it.

Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: the problem isn't the data. It's that every tool measures differently, and nobody's connecting the dots.

The marketing directors who actually get budget increases? They can answer one question in 10 seconds: "Which campaign generated the deals that closed last quarter?"

If you can't answer that, it's not a you problem. It's a tooling problem.

We built something that answers it in 15 minutes. No engineering required.

Link in comments.

What's your biggest attribution headache? Genuinely curious.

## Post 2 — Hook Formula #4: Contrarian Challenge

**Hook**: Everyone says "just pick an attribution model and stick with it." That's surface-level thinking.

**Full post**:

Everyone says "just pick an attribution model and stick with it."

That's surface-level thinking.

First-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay — the model isn't the problem. The problem is that your tools don't talk to each other.

I talk to marketing directors every week. When I ask about attribution, they say "we use last-touch in GA4."

But their pipeline comes from:
- A LinkedIn post someone saw 3 months ago
- An email they clicked 6 weeks ago
- A comparison page they found via Google
- A demo they booked after a colleague mentioned it at lunch

Last-touch gives credit to... the demo booking form. That tells you nothing useful.

The marketing leaders who get this right don't pick a better model. They connect their data first. Model second.

When you can see the full journey — not just the last click — you stop debating attribution models and start finding the campaigns that actually generate revenue.

Takes about 15 minutes to set up. No code.

What attribution model does your team use? And do you trust it?

## Post 3 — Hook Formula #3: Social Proof Opening

**Hook**: I sat in on 12 SaaS board meetings last year. Same scene every time.

**Full post**:

I sat in on 12 SaaS board meetings last year. Same scene every time.

CEO: "Marketing spent $180K last quarter. What did we get?"

Marketing lead: *pulls up a slide with impressions, clicks, and MQLs*

Board: *glazes over*

CEO: "But how many deals did marketing actually generate?"

Marketing lead: "Well, it's complicated because attribution—"

That's the moment marketing loses the room.

The 3 companies where this didn't happen? They walked in with one slide: "Marketing generated $2.1M in pipeline last quarter. Here are the 5 campaigns that drove it, ranked by revenue per dollar spent."

The difference wasn't the team's skill. It was whether they had 15 minutes of setup vs. 15 weeks of engineering work.

If you can't show the revenue slide in your next board meeting, that's the problem worth solving.

What does your board meeting attribution slide look like? Drop it below — no judgment.

## Post 4 — Hook Formula #1: Observation + Stat + Contrast + Promise

**Hook**: I've been watching something interesting happen in B2B marketing.

**Full post**:

I've been watching something interesting happen in B2B marketing.

67% of marketing directors say they can't prove ROI to their CEO. That's from a recent survey of 500+ B2B marketers.

But here's the contrast: 89% of the ones who CAN prove ROI say the same thing made the difference.

It wasn't a better team. It wasn't more budget. It wasn't a new channel.

It was connecting their existing data in one place. That's it.

Most marketing teams have all the data they need. It's sitting in GA4, their CRM, their ad platforms, and their email tool. They just can't see it together.

The 11% who figured this out aren't using magic. They're using tools that connect the dots in minutes instead of months.

3 things they all have in common:
1. Single source of truth for revenue attribution
2. No engineering dependency
3. Real-time visibility (not monthly report cycles)

If you're in the 67%, it's not a skills gap. It's a plumbing problem.

What's the one thing standing between you and proving marketing ROI?

## Post 5 — Hook Formula #2: Personal Limitation + Achievement

**Hook**: I'm not a data scientist. Never will be.

**Full post**:

I'm not a data scientist. Never will be.

But last week I showed our CEO exactly which 3 campaigns generated $840K in pipeline last quarter — broken down by channel, content piece, and cost per opportunity.

A year ago, this would have required:
- 2 weeks of engineering time
- A BI analyst to build the queries
- 3 different tools stitched together with duct tape

What changed wasn't my technical skills. I still can't write SQL.

What changed was the tooling. Connected everything in 15 minutes on a Tuesday morning. Had the board-ready slide by lunch.

The biggest unlock for marketing directors right now isn't learning analytics. It's using tools that don't require you to.

If your "prove ROI" workflow involves engineering tickets or spreadsheet gymnastics, you're solving the wrong problem.

What's the most time you've spent building a single marketing report?

## Annotations (Why These Work)

| Post | Hook Formula | Why This Framework Was Chosen |
|------|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Harsh Reality | Opens with uncomfortable truth the audience already suspects. Builds trust by naming the problem they live with. |
| 2 | Contrarian Challenge | Challenges conventional wisdom (attribution models). Positions the reader as someone who's been thinking about it wrong — then gives the fix. |
| 3 | Social Proof | Specific setting (board meetings), specific number (12), specific scenario. The reader sees themselves in the story. |
| 4 | Observation + Stat | Leads with data, creates contrast between majority (67% failing) and minority (who solved it). Makes the reader want to be in the minority. |
| 5 | Personal Limitation | Vulnerability + achievement. "I can't do X but I did Y" is inherently compelling because it implies the reader can too. |

**Engagement closers used**: Direct question (posts 1-5), each specific to the topic, not generic. Per marketing-wisdom.md guidelines.
