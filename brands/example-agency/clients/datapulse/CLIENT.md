## Our Mandate

**Primary KPI we own**: Organic-sourced pipeline (demo requests from organic traffic)

**Current baseline**: 45 demo requests/month from organic (up from 12 when we started)
**Target**: 80 demo requests/month from organic by Q3 2026

## Brand Notes

**Their brand voice**: Technical but accessible. They write for product managers, not executives. Humor is okay — they use it in their product UI.
**Don't say**: Don't compare them to Mixpanel directly in ad copy (legal concern). Fine in organic content.
**Required elements**: Always link to their free tier when possible, not just the demo page.

## Notes

Jamie (VP Marketing) is data-savvy and wants to see the attribution for everything. Always include UTM tracking plans in briefs. Marcus (CEO) joins quarterly reviews and cares about pipeline numbers, not traffic numbers — always frame results in revenue terms for exec presentations.
