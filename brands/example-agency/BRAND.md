---

## Value Proposition

**One-liner**: "B2B SaaS growth marketing backed by data from 80+ campaigns — so you scale what works, not what sounds good."

**Three proof points** (specific numbers, not claims):
1. Average client sees 2.4x pipeline growth in the first 6 months
2. 94% client retention rate over 3 years
3. 80+ B2B SaaS campaigns across 12 verticals — from seed stage to Series D

---

## Brand Voice

**Tone**: Direct, data-driven, warm but no-nonsense. We sound like a sharp advisor, not a vendor.

**Personality**: Specific, honest, results-obsessed

### Voice Markers (What We Always Sound Like)

- We lead with outcomes, not process: "You'll see pipeline impact in 90 days" not "We have a proven methodology"
- We use specific numbers: "2.4x pipeline growth" not "strong results"
- We're direct: Short sentences. No hedging. No "it depends."
- We speak as peers, not vendors: "Here's what we'd do" not "We recommend exploring"
- We name what we don't know: "We haven't tested this in healthcare SaaS yet — here's how we'd approach it"

### Anti-Patterns (What We Never Sound Like)

- Never say: "leverage," "synergize," "holistic approach," "best-in-class," "cutting-edge," "seamless"
- Never use: corporate passive voice ("it was determined that...")
- Never start emails with: "I hope this finds you well" or "I wanted to reach out"
- Never: vague claims without proof ("many clients," "great results," "significant improvement")
