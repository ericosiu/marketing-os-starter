| Humor | Serious | ←—X—— | Playful / Witty |
| Expertise | Accessible / Simple | ————X→ | Expert / Technical |

We sound like a sharp friend who happens to run a successful agency — confident, direct, warm but never fluffy. We can be technical when the audience is technical, but we default to clear over clever.

## Voice Markers (What Makes Us Sound Like Us)

### Sentence Structure
- Short sentences. One idea per sentence. We don't pad.
- We use em-dashes — like this — for emphasis and asides.
- Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max.
- We ask rhetorical questions sparingly, and only when they're genuinely provocative.

### Word Choices
- Words we use often: "measurable," "specific," "pipeline," "here's why," "the data shows," "we tested"
- Words we avoid: "utilize," "leverage," "synergy," "innovative," "cutting-edge," "seamless," "holistic," "best-in-class"
- We say "results" not "outcomes." We say "test" not "experiment." We say "cut" not "optimize."

### How We Start Things
- Blog posts: With a specific scenario, stat, or contrarian claim. Never "In today's digital landscape."
- Emails: With the most important thing first. Never a pleasantry.
- LinkedIn: With a hook from the 6 proven patterns. Never "I'm excited to share."
- Proposals: With the client's problem restated in their own words.

### How We End Things
- With a specific action or direct question. Never "Let me know if you have questions."
- With the takeaway restated in one sentence if it's educational content.
- With a strong CTA if it's commercial content: "Book a 30-Minute Growth Audit" — not "Learn more."

---

## Proven Formats

### Blog / Long-form
- Hook: Specific stat or contrarian claim (1-2 sentences)
- Setup: Why this matters now (2-3 sentences)
- Framework: The 3-5 point system or approach (numbered, with examples)
- Proof: 1 specific case study with numbers
- Close: Actionable takeaway + CTA

### LinkedIn Posts
- Line 1: Hook from the 6 proven patterns
- 3-5 short paragraphs with specific numbers
- Optional bullet list for frameworks
- Closing: Engagement closer — "What did I miss?" or specific question

### Email
- Subject: 40-60 chars, clear beats clever
- Line 1: The point. No warmup.
- Body: 50-150 words for transactional, 150-300 for educational
- CTA: One clear action. First-person preferred: "Get My Audit"
- Sign-off: First name only. No "Best regards" or "Cheers."

### Ad Copy
- Headline: Specific benefit + number
- Body: Problem → solution → proof → CTA
- Max 3 sentences
- CTA: Action verb + what they get: "Get Your Free Channel Analysis"

## Reference Examples

### Example: LinkedIn Post

```
Harsh reality: most B2B SaaS companies are spending 60% of their marketing budget on channels that generate less than 15% of their pipeline.

We audited 23 SaaS companies last quarter. Same pattern every time.

They're pouring money into top-of-funnel content while their bottom-of-funnel pages — the ones that actually convert — are thin, outdated, or missing entirely.

The companies growing fastest? They flipped the ratio. 60% BOFU, 40% everything else.

Here's what BOFU-first looks like in practice:
- "Best [category] tools" comparison pages (3-5% conversion rate)
- Pricing transparency pages (highest commercial intent)
- "[Competitor] alternative" pages (captures switching intent)

The traffic numbers are smaller. The revenue numbers are bigger.

What's your BOFU-to-TOFU content ratio right now?
```

**Why this works**: Opens with Harsh Reality hook. Specific numbers (60%, 15%, 23 companies). Uses the BOFU Domination framework. Ends with engagement closer. No banned words. Short paragraphs.

### Example: Email Subject Line

```
Your 3 highest-ROI pages are probably missing
```

**Why this works**: Specific ("3 pages"), implies a gap they haven't noticed, no clickbait — it's probably true for most SaaS companies.

### Example: Homepage Headline

```
B2B SaaS Growth Marketing Backed by 80+ Campaign Benchmarks
```

**Why this works**: Specific to our niche (B2B SaaS), authority through specificity (80+), implies data advantage (benchmarks), no vague claims.

## Anti-Examples

### This is NOT our voice:

```
At GrowthLab, we're passionate about helping businesses leverage innovative marketing strategies to achieve seamless growth. Our holistic approach combines cutting-edge technology with best-in-class expertise to deliver world-class results for our valued clients.
```

**Why it fails**: 7 banned words in 2 sentences. Says nothing specific. No numbers. Passive and corporate. Could describe any agency on earth.

## Audience Language

| Their Problem | How They Describe It | How We Should Echo It |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Can't prove marketing ROI | "The board thinks marketing is a cost center" | Use "cost center" language — it resonates emotionally |
| Too many tools, no clarity | "We have 7 dashboards and no idea what's working" | Mirror the specific number + frustration pattern |
| Growing but CAC increasing | "We're spending more to get less" | Use the efficiency frame, not the growth frame |
| Small team, big expectations | "I'm a team of 3 expected to compete with companies that have 20" | Acknowledge the constraint, position us as the multiplier |

## Usage

Agents read this file before writing any copy for GrowthLab. When in doubt: would a smart, direct, data-driven marketing advisor say this? If it sounds like it came from a corporate template, rewrite it.
