# [AGENCY NAME] — Voice Guide

**Purpose**: This file tells the AI agents exactly how to write for this brand. Be specific — vague direction produces vague output.

---

## Tone Spectrum

Where does your brand sit on each axis? Mark with an X or describe:

| Dimension | One End | ← Mark Position → | Other End |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Formality | Casual / Conversational | | Formal / Professional |
| Energy | Quiet / Measured | | Bold / High-energy |
| Humor | Serious | | Playful / Witty |
| Expertise | Accessible / Simple | | Expert / Technical |

**[FILL IN: 1-2 sentences describing the overall feel]**
Example: "We sound like a sharp friend who happens to be an expert — confident, direct, warm, never corporate."

- [FILL IN: e.g., "Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max."]

### Word Choices
