### Voice Markers (What We Always Sound Like)

[FILL IN: Specific characteristics — be precise]

Examples to fill in:
- We lead with outcomes, not process: "You'll get X result" not "We have a proven methodology"
- We use specific numbers: "3.2x ROI" not "strong returns"
- We're direct: Short sentences. No hedging. No "it depends."
- We speak as peers, not vendors: We say "here's what we'd do" not "we recommend exploring"

### Anti-Patterns (What We Never Sound Like)

[FILL IN: What your brand explicitly avoids]

Examples to fill in:
- Never say: "leverage," "synergize," "holistic approach," "best-in-class"
- Never use: corporate passive voice ("it was determined that...")
- Never start emails with: "I hope this finds you well" or "I wanted to reach out"
- Never: vague claims without proof ("many clients," "great results")
