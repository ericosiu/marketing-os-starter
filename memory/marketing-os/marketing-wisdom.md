## A. Content Hook Formulas

Every piece of content lives or dies in the first line. These 6 patterns are proven to stop the scroll.

### The 6 Proven Hook Patterns

**1. Observation + Stat + Contrast + Promise**
> "I've been watching [trend]. [Specific stat]. [What most people think vs. what's actually true]. I'm going to show you [what to do about it]."

Example: "I've been watching something interesting happen. ChatGPT has over a billion searches per day now. 95% of the sources it cites are from the last 10 months. If your best content is from 2023, you're not in the game. Here's how to fix that."

**2. Personal Limitation + Achievement**
> "I can't [thing]. Never have been able to. But this week I [specific achievement that seems impossible given the limitation]."

Example: "I can't code. Never have been able to. But this week I built systems that used to require an entire development team."

**3. Social Proof Opening**
> "I [was with / talked to] [specific number] [impressive group] [recently]. [Surprising finding]. [Stat that backs it up]."

Example: "I had lunch with 40 8-9 figure founders a few weeks ago. I asked how many were using AI coding tools. 70% raised their hands. And most of these people aren't technical."

**4. Contrarian Challenge**
> "Everyone says [common wisdom]. That's surface-level thinking. [What actually matters is...]"

Example: "I talk to SEO professionals all the time. When I ask them about AI and search, they say 'optimize for keywords and tags.' That's surface-level thinking. Everyone's doing that already. What actually matters is understanding that every platform works differently."

**5. Simple Declarative**
> "[Bold, clear statement that frames the entire piece]."

Example: "High performers want to hang out with other high performers."

**6. Harsh Reality**
> "Harsh reality: [uncomfortable truth most people are avoiding]."

Example: "Harsh reality: most people are coming back to the office."

### Story Pattern

Every good marketing story follows this structure:
**Context** → **Specific details** (names, places, times, actual numbers) → **Point/Lesson**

Stories without specifics are forgettable. "I met a successful entrepreneur" is weak. "I met a founder running a $200M ad agency in Tokyo who took me to a fish auction at 3:30am" is memorable.

### Engagement Closers

End content with one of these — never with "Like and share" or "Follow for more":
- "What did I miss?"
- "What do you think?"
- "Leave a reply below."
- Direct provocative question that invites debate

### Numbers That Create Authority

Use specific numbers to signal credibility:
- **Revenue thresholds**: "$13M+", "$200M+", "9-figure"
- **Specific stats**: "95%", "70%", "3-5x"
- **Time frames**: "in the last 10 months", "this week", "a few weeks ago"
- **Group sizes**: "40 founders", "30,000 members", "16,500 members"

Vague numbers destroy authority. "Many companies" = weak. "70% of the 40 founders I surveyed" = strong.

### Short-Form Video Patterns

**Clone Format (Side-by-Side Comparison):**
- Left side: "Average [Role]" doing it wrong (3-5 bullet mistakes)
- Right side: "Smart [Role]" doing it right (3-5 bullet improvements)
- Same inputs, dramatically different outcomes
- Caption: Result statement + CTA

**Hot Take Format:**
- Written hook: Bold, slightly provocative statement
- Verbal hook: "Alright, I'm kidding. [What's actually true]."
- Body: 3 numbered steps
- CTA: Follow-up offer

### Banned Openers

Never start content with:
- "I'm excited to share..."
- "In today's world..."
- "As a [title], I..."
- "I wanted to reach out..."
- Generic questions that aren't genuinely surprising
- "I hope this finds you well"

## B. BOFU Domination Framework

Most marketers optimize for traffic. The highest ROI comes from optimizing for revenue — and that means dominating bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) content.

### The Core Insight

Decision-stage content converts 10-50x better than top-of-funnel blog posts. A "best [service] agency" page with 500 monthly visits will generate more revenue than a "what is [service]" page with 50,000 visits.

### 6 BOFU Content Categories

Research and create content in ALL of these categories:

**1. Agency/Service Comparison Pages**
- "Best [service] agency for [industry]"
- "Top [service] agencies [year]"
- "[Service] agency comparison"
- Target: 10K+ monthly searches combined

**2. Pricing & Cost Transparency Pages**
- "[Service] agency cost"
- "How much does [service] cost"
- "[Service] pricing guide"
- Highest commercial intent — people searching pricing are ready to buy

**3. Industry-Specific Service Pages**
- "[Industry] marketing agency" (fintech, healthcare, legal, real estate, SaaS, etc.)
- Each vertical: 20 pillar articles + case studies + free tools
- Premium positioning: verticals charge 2-3x generalist rates

**4. Platform-Specific Pages**
- "[Platform] marketing agency" (Shopify, HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Partner listings and certifications as proof points

**5. "vs" Comparison Pages**
- "[Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]"
- "In-house vs agency"
- "[Service A] vs [Service B]"

**6. Buyer's Guide & Selection Pages**
- "How to choose a [service] agency"
- "What to look for in a [service] provider"
- "[Service] agency vetting checklist"
- "Questions to ask a [service] agency"

### BOFU Content Architecture

Use a hub-spoke model:
- **Hub**: Main service page (e.g., "/seo-services")
- **Spokes**: Industry pages, comparison pages, pricing pages, vs pages, buyer's guides
- Internal link every spoke back to the hub
- Each spoke targets a specific long-tail keyword cluster

### Measurement

Don't measure BOFU content by traffic. Measure by:
- Conversion rate (target: 3-5%+ for BOFU pages)
- Free consult/demo submissions
- Revenue attributed to organic landing page
- Cost per acquisition vs. paid channels

## C. Exponential Growth Playbooks

7 strategies that create compounding growth loops instead of linear traffic.

### Playbook 1: Free Tool Flywheel

Turn free tools into a growth engine:

**Credits System:**
- Free users: 10 uses/day
- Email signup: 50 uses/day
- Referral: +25 uses per friend
- Social share: +10 uses
- Link back to your site: unlimited

**Marketplace Approach:**
- Don't build 1 tool. Build 25.
- Each tool = separate landing page = separate keyword = separate traffic source
- Cross-link all tools = internal linking powerhouse
- Each tool captures emails independently

### Playbook 2: LLM Citation Strategy

Become the source AI models cite when answering questions in your space:

- Create micro-pages answering specific questions in your domain
- Format data as "According to [Your Brand] research..."
- Use schema.org/Dataset markup for AI comprehension
- Add "Cite This" buttons to make sharing frictionless
- Publish fresh data regularly — AI models prioritize recent content

### Playbook 3: Vertical Domination

Launch vertical content brands instead of being a generalist:

- Each vertical gets: 20 pillar articles + 10 case studies + free tools
- Each links back to main brand
- Network effect: more verticals = more internal links = more authority
- Vertical specialists command 2-3x higher pricing

### Playbook 4: Programmatic SEO 2.0

Create pages at scale with a quality layer:

- **Pattern 1**: "[Industry] [Service] Agency" (1,000+ pages)
- **Pattern 2**: "[Service] Agency in [City]" (500+ pages)
- **Pattern 3**: "[Tool A] vs [Tool B]" comparisons (300+ pages)
- Quality layer: AI generates base → human review → deploy
- Each page must add unique value — no thin content

### Playbook 5: Language Arbitrage

Target underserved language markets:

- Non-English content in many markets has dramatically better CTR (up to 13x)
- LATAM, European, and Asian markets are underserved in many B2B categories
- Publish in target language first, then translate to English
- Lower competition = faster rankings = cheaper traffic

### Playbook 6: "Marketing Mistakes" Content

Create content about what NOT to do:

- Nobody creates "how to avoid failure" content — the space is wide open
- Failure/pain content has 3-5x higher engagement than success content
- Attracts burned prospects (high-value, motivated buyers who've tried and failed)
- Lower keyword competition on negative/mistake terms

### Playbook 7: Data Network Effects

Build a system where user-generated data makes the platform smarter:

- Create a benchmarks database: users submit data → get personalized report
- More submissions = better benchmarks = more traffic = more submissions
- This becomes "the Glassdoor of [your industry]"
- License the data to create a separate revenue stream

## D. Activation & Retention Science

### The Activation Gap

Most products have a massive gap between signup and first value delivery. Users sign up, see an empty dashboard, don't know what to do, and leave. The fix is systematic, not motivational.

### 5-Move Activation Playbook

**Move 1: Fix Identity Tracking**
- Prerequisite for everything. If you can't measure the funnel, you can't fix it.
- Ensure a single identity chain from signup through first value moment.

**Move 2: Zero-Friction First Value**
- Remove every wall between signup and first output.
- Auto-generate the first piece of value. Don't ask users to configure anything first.
- Target: first value in under 2 minutes.
- If user doesn't provide input, use defaults. Nobody should see an empty screen.

**Move 3: Automated Value Queue**
- Turn your product from pull (user has to come back and do something) to push (product generates value and notifies user).
- After first value, auto-queue 3 more outputs.
- Send notification when they're ready.

**Move 4: Segment-Specific Interventions**

Not all inactive users are the same. Build 3 segments and treat each differently:

| Segment | Definition | Intervention |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Ghost Users** | Signed up, 0 actions | Send sample output email. If no response in 7 days, personal founder email: "What blocked you?" |
| **One-and-Done** | 1+ action, no return in 7 days | Show them the potential: "Your [thing] could [achieve result] — here's what to do next" |
| **Power Users** | 5+ actions/week | Personal outreach for case study. Offer team seats. Ask for referrals. These are your champions. |

**Move 5: Close the Feedback Loop**
- Show users the results of their actions.
- "Your [output] achieved [result]" creates the motivation to do more.
- Auto-suggest next action based on results.

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Typical | Target After 8 Weeks |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Session → First Value | 5-10% | 30% |
| Week 1 retention | 25-30% | 45% |
| Actions per user/month | Low single digits | 15+ |
| Month 2 retention | ~20% | 35% |

---

## E. Price Ladder Architecture

### Strategic Price Escalation

Never launch at full price. Build a ladder:

| Stage | Pricing | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Presale** | Lowest (e.g., 30% of target) | Validate demand, build early advocates |
| **Launch** | Below target (e.g., 50-70%) | Drive adoption, gather case studies |
| **Self-serve** | Target price | Standard product pricing |
| **Managed** | Premium (e.g., 5-10x self-serve) | Done-for-you layer on top of product |
| **Full service** | Highest | Complete agency/consulting engagement |

### Upsell Signal Detection

Don't upsell randomly. Watch for these signals:

- **Usage volume**: User hits usage limits consistently → upsell to higher tier
- **Feature requests**: Asks for features in the premium tier → show the tier
- **Company size**: Growth indicators (hiring, funding) → offer managed services
- **Results**: Getting great results → "Want us to do more of this for you?"

### The Product-to-Services Funnel

This is the agency's edge: products generate leads for services.

```
Free trial → Paid self-serve → Managed services → Full agency engagement
   ($0)        ($X/month)        ($XX/month)         ($XXX/month)
```

Each tier generates leads for the next. The product isn't just revenue — it's a qualification filter.

## F. Campaign Measurement Philosophy

### ROI-First Thinking

Before building any campaign, define:
1. **What is the minimum ROI?** (e.g., 4:1 — every $1 spent returns $4)
2. **How will we measure it?** (specific metric, not "awareness")
3. **What's the timeline?** (when do we evaluate success?)

### Revenue Metrics Over Vanity Metrics

| Don't Optimize For | Optimize For |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Impressions | Revenue per impression |
| Clicks | Cost per qualified lead |
| Traffic | Revenue per visitor |
| Open rates | Revenue per email send |
| Followers | Revenue per follower |
| Page views | Conversion rate |

### Conservative Projections

When projecting campaign results:
- Use 50% of the "expected" conversion rate
- Plan for 2x the expected timeline
- If it still hits your ROI bar at conservative numbers, it's worth doing
- If it only works at optimistic numbers, it's a gamble

## How to Grow This File

After every campaign that runs, add what you learned:
- What hook pattern worked best?
- What segment responded most?
- What channel over/underperformed expectations?
- What would you do differently?

This file should get smarter with every campaign. After 20 campaigns, it becomes your agency's unfair advantage.
