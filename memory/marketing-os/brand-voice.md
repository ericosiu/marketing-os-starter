# Brand Voice Memory

**Purpose**: Runtime memory for agents. This file accumulates voice patterns and anti-patterns as the team generates copy. It evolves over time — unlike the static `brands/your-agency/voice.md`.

**Updated by**: MOS-Copywriter (after each deliverable) and manually by owner
**Last updated**: [Date will be filled in automatically]

## Notes for Agents

Read this file at the start of every copywriting session. If voice.md conflicts with this file, flag it — the brand may have evolved.

When you produce copy that the owner approves as "perfect voice match," add the key patterns here. This is how the system gets smarter over time.
