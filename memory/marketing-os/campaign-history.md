# Campaign History

**Purpose**: Track every campaign that runs through Marketing OS. Agents read this before creating new campaigns to avoid repeating failures and to build on successes.

**Updated by**: MOS-Orchestrator (after each campaign concludes) and manually by owner

## Campaign Log Format

When adding a campaign, use this structure:

```

**Channel**: [where it ran]
**Duration**: [start date] to [end date]

**Deliverables**:
- [List what was produced]

**Results**:
- Primary KPI: [metric] → [result] ([vs. target])
- Secondary: [metric] → [result]

**What worked**: [specific elements that performed]
**What failed**: [specific elements that didn't]

## Instructions for Agents

Before creating a campaign brief, check this file:
1. Has a similar campaign been run before?
2. What worked? What failed?
3. Are there reusable creative elements?

Do not repeat approaches marked "What failed" without a clear reason why this time will be different.
